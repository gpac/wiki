## Contributing

A complex project like GPAC wouldn’t exist and persist without the support of its community. Please contribute: a nice message, supporting us in our communication, reporting issues when you see them … any gesture, even the smallest ones, counts. 

## Getting support and reporting issues 

Please use [github issues](https://github.com/gpac/gpac/issues) for feature requests and bug reports. When filing a request there, please tag it as feature-request.


## API documentation

The [API documentation](https://doxygen.gpac.io/modules.html) provides information on the GPAC  Filter API.

GPAC's core is writen in C, but it can be easily extended using [Javascipt Filters](/Developers/javascript), used in a [Python](/Howtos/python) or [NodeJS application](/Developers/javascript).

This section describes how to build GPAC from scratch and how to develop with it. 

You can get pre-compiled binaries on [the GPAC website](https://gpac.io/downloads/gpac-nightly-builds/).

When building GPAC you will have the option to either do a full build with all GPAC applications, or just build a static MP4Box binary if you only want this command line tool. Both method are described for each OS. 

The build instructions in this section are the same ones used to build the official GPAC releases on the website. There might other build method that works. 

This section also includes older building documentation that might still contain useful information, in particular for older systems. 

For build related issues specific to GPAC, you can open tickets in [the issue tracker](https://github.com/gpac/gpac/issues).

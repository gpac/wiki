# MABR & ROUTE input  
  
Register name used to load filter: __routein__  
This filter may be automatically loaded during graph resolution.  
  
This filter is a receiver for file delivery over multicast. It currently supports ATSC 3.0, generic ROUTE and DVB-MABR flute.  

- ATSC 3.0 mode is identified by the URL `atsc://`.  
- Generic ROUTE mode is identified by the URL `route://IP:PORT`.  
- DVB-MABR mode is identified by the URL `mabr://IP:PORT` pointing to the bootstrap FLUTE channel carrying the multicast gateway configuration.  

  
The filter can work in cached mode, source mode or standalone mode.  

# Cached mode  
  
The cached mode is the default filter behavior. It populates GPAC HTTP Cache with the received files, using `http://gmcast/serviceN/` as service root, `N being the multicast service ID.`  
In cached mode, repeated files are always pushed to cache.  
The maximum number of media segment objects in cache per service is defined by [nbcached](#nbcached); this is a safety used to force object removal in case DASH client timing is wrong and some files are never requested at cache level.  
    
The cached MPD is assigned the following headers:  

- `x-mcast`: boolean value, if `yes` indicates the file comes from a multicast.  
- `x-mcast-first-seg`: string value, indicates the name of the first segment (completely or currently being) retrieved from the broadcast.  
- `x-mcast-ll`: boolean value, if yes indicates that the indicated first segment is currently being received (low latency signaling).  
- `x-mcast-loop`: boolean value, if yes indicates a loop (e.g. pcap replay) in the service has been detected - only checked if [cloop](#cloop) is set.  

    
The cached files are assigned the following headers:  

- `x-mcast`: boolean value, if `yes` indicates the file comes from a multicast.  

  
If [max_segs](#max_segs) is set, file deletion event will be triggered in the filter chain.  
  
# Source mode  
  
In source mode, the filter outputs files on a single output PID of type `file`. The files are dispatched once fully received, the output PID carries a sequence of complete files. Repeated files are not sent unless requested.  
Example
```
gpac -i atsc://gcache=false -o $ServiceID$/$File$:dynext
```
  
This will grab the files and forward them as output PIDs, consumed by the [fout](fout) filter.  
  
If needed, one PID per TSI can be used rather than a single PID using [stsi](#stsi). This avoids mixing files of different mime types on the same PID (e.g. HAS manifest and ISOBMFF).  
In this mode, each packet starting a new file carries the file name as a property. If [repair](#repair) is enabled in this mode, progressive dispatch of files will be done.  
  
If [max_segs](#max_segs) is set, file deletion event will be triggered in the filter chain.  
_Note: The [nbcached](#nbcached) option is ignored in this mode._  
  
# Standalone mode  
  
In standalone mode, the filter does not produce any output PID and writes received files to the [odir](#odir) directory.  
Example
```
gpac -i atsc://:odir=output
```
  
This will grab the files and write them to `output` directory.  
  
In this mode, files are always written once completely recieved, regardless of the [repair](#repair) option.  
  
If [max_segs](#max_segs) is set, old files will be deleted.  
_Note: The [nbcached](#nbcached) option is ignored in this mode._  
  
# File Repair  
  
In case of losses or incomplete segment reception (during tune-in), the files are patched as follows:  

- MPEG-2 TS: all lost ranges are adjusted to 188-bytes boundaries, and transformed into NULL TS packets.  
- ISOBMFF: all top-level boxes are scanned, and incomplete boxes are transformed in `free` boxes, except `mdat`:  

    - if `repair=simple`, `mdat` is kept if incomplete (broken file),  
    - if `repair=strict`, `mdat` is moved to `free` if incomplete and the preceeding `moof` is also moved to `free`.  

  
If [kc](#kc) option is set, corrupted files will be kept. If [fullseg](#fullseg) is not set and files are only partially received, they will be kept.  
  
# Interface setup  
  
On some systems (OSX), when using VM packet replay, you may need to force multicast routing on your local interface.  
For ATSC, you will have to do this for the base signaling multicast (224.0.23.60):  
```
route add -net 224.0.23.60/32 -interface vboxnet0
```
  
Then for each multicast service in the multicast:  
```
route add -net 239.255.1.4/32 -interface vboxnet0
```

# SCTE35 decoder  
  
Register name used to load filter: __scte35dec__  
This filter is not checked during graph resolution and needs explicit loading.  
  
This filter writes the SCTE-35 markers attached as properties to audio and video  
packets or inside a dedicated stream, as 23001-18 'emib' boxes. It also creates  
empty 'emeb' box in between following segmentation as hinted by the graph.
